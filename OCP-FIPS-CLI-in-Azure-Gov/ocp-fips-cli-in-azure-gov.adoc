=== Introduction
-------
This is a quick step-by-step guide to deploy a cluster to Azure Gov Cloud via CLI from a bastion host.
-------


.Assumptions:
  . Have the proper Microsoft Azure Gov credentials
    - The list of pre-reqs can be found here: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.6/html-single/installing_on_azure/index#installing-azure-account
  . Have the 'az' cli tool for Azure installed on the bastion host
  . Have the 'oc' cli tool for OpenShift installed on the bastion host
  . Having direct access to the internet for the 'openshift-install' command to download the proper install configs]
  . Have a ssh-key created for the installation config to use
  . Retrieve the 'pull-secret' from OpenShift Subscription for the installation config to use
  . Retrieve the _<baseDomainResourceGroupName>_ for the installation config
  . Retrieve the _<region>_ for the installation config




=== Installation:
 . Verify that you are attached to the proper Azure Cloud
   - Run `az cloud list -o table`
  image:images/az-cloud-list-table.png[]
 . You will need to be attached to the "AzureUSGovernment" cloud - if you are not then type the following
   - `az cloud set --name AzureUSGovernment --profile latest`
   - This will set the 'IsActive' to the correct cloud provider by Azure
   - You will now see a "True" for "AzureUSGovernment" +

IMPORTANT: **If you do not have the proper Azure Cloud set the rest of the configuration will not work properly**

  . Next you will create the 'install-config.yaml' file. Below is an example of a basic install-config.yaml file
    - You will need to

  ---
.install-config.yaml
[source,yaml]

  apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: rhocp.us
compute:
- hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  platform:
    azure:
      type: Standard_D2s_v3
      osDisk:
        diskSizeGB: 512
  replicas: 3
controlPlane:
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: master
  platform:
    azure:
      osDisk:
        diskSizeGB: 512
      type: Standard_D8s_v3
  replicas: 3
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: vaocp
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  machineNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
  networkType: OpenShiftSDN
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
platform:
  azure:
    baseDomainResourceGroupName: MAG-GlobalDNS
    region: usgovvirginia
    cloudName: AzureUSGovernmentCloud
publish: External
fips: true
  pullSecret: ''
  sshKey: ''

  ---

IMPORTANT: **Make sure to copy & paste the 'pull-secret' & the 'sshKey' into the file or the installation will fail**

IMPORTANT: **Take special note of the "cloudName:", this line must exist in the install-config for OpenShift to know where to place the newly created cluster**

. The next step will be to deploy the cluster by running the following command +
  `./openshift-install create cluster --dir=_<install-dir>_ --log-level=debug`

. This command will take several minutes to complete. You will be able to watch the debug info on the screen and/or the progress in the Azure Gov UI

NOTE: **Azure Gov is fairly slow to install to, this is not reflective of OpenShift itself but of the Cloud Provider response time**
