This is a step-by-step guide to allow OpenShift ACM to deploy a cluster to Azure Gov Cloud. 

.Assumptions:  
- Have a OCP Cluster already built on *OCP 4.6.x*
- Connection to the internet for 'Operator Hub' to be able to pull operators
- Access to the following info:
    * OCP pull-secret
    * Public & Priv ssh keys
    * Azure Gov Creds
        ** TenantID
        ** SubscriptionID
        ** ClientID
        ** ClientSecret


*Installation of Operator: Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes*
---

1. In the OCP cluster that ACM will be installed go to 'OperaterHub' and search for "Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes"
    - Select it and keep the defaults - then *Install*
    - Wait for installation to finish - should only take about 3 minutes
2. While the operator is being installed there is a need to create a Secret for the 'MultiClusterHub' to use
    - On the left select 'Workloads' then select 'Secrets'
    - Verify that the 'Project' dropdown has 'open-cluster-management' so the secret can be used by the 'MultiClusterHub'
    - Inside of 'Secrets' click the "Create" in the upper right and then select 'Image Pull Secret' from the dropdown
    - Give the new 'Secret' a name
    - Then change the 'Authentication Type' to "Upload Configuration File"
        * You can either choose to upload a file via the 'Browse' or cut and paste the pull-secret that you used for building the OCP Cluster
    - Click 'Create'
3. Once the installation of the operator has finished and it shows "Success" & the secret is created, click on 'Installed Operators' then click on 'MultiClusterHub'
4. Inside 'MultiClusterHub' click on *'Create MultiClusterHub'* 
5. Leave the 'Name' section alone - it *MUST* be named 'multiclusterhub'
6. Click on 'Advanced Configuration' drop down
    - Under 'Image Pull Secret' drop down select the 'Secret' name you created in the previous step
7. Then click 'Create'
    - This process will take about 10 min for OCP to finish the install/configuration of the 'MultiClusterHub'
    - Once the 'Status' shows "Phase: Running" you shoud be good-to-go
8. Select 'Networking' on the left and then 'Routes'
    - *AGAIN* Verify that the 'Project' dropdown at the top of the screen has 'open-cluster-management'
9. Inside of 'Routes' click on the 'Location' link to bring up the 'multicloud-console' to access ACM
10. Login to the 'multicloud-console' page with your OCP Cluster Kubeadmin username/password
