Introduction
-------
This is a step-by-step guide to allow OpenShift ACM to deploy a cluster to Azure Gov Cloud. Red Hat Advanced
Cluster Management for Kubernetes provides end-to-end management visibility and control to manage your Kubernetes
environment. Provides management capabilities for cluster creation, application lifecycle, and provide security
and compliance for all of them across data centers and hybrid cloud environments. Clusters and applications are
all visible and managed from a single console, with built-in security policies. Run your operations from anywhere
that Red Hat OpenShift runs, and manage any Kubernetes cluster in your fleet.

.Assumptions:
- Have a OCP Cluster already built on *OCP 4.6.x*
- This assumes you are connected to the internet for deploying a new cluster via IPI using ACM
- Connection to the internet for 'Operator Hub' to be able to pull operators
- Access to the following info:
    * OCP pull-secret
    * Public & Priv ssh keys
    * Azure Gov Creds
        ** TenantID
        ** SubscriptionID
        ** ClientID
        ** ClientSecret




=== Installation of Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes
:hardbreaks:

.Installation of ACM Operator & Configuration of MultiClusterHub


. In the OCP cluster that ACM will be installed go to 'OperaterHub' and search for "Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes"
    - Select it and keep the defaults - then *Install*
    - Wait for installation to finish - should only take about 3 minutes
. While the operator is being installed there is a need to create a Secret for the 'MultiClusterHub' to use
    - On the left select 'Workloads' then select 'Secrets'
    - Verify that the 'Project' dropdown has 'open-cluster-management' so the secret can be used by the 'MultiClusterHub'
    - Inside of 'Secrets' click the "Create" in the upper right and then select 'Image Pull Secret' from the dropdown
    - Give the new 'Secret' a name
    - Then change the 'Authentication Type' to "Upload Configuration File"
        * You can either choose to upload a file via the 'Browse' or cut and paste the pull-secret that you used for building the OCP Cluster
    - Click 'Create'
. Once the installation of the operator has finished and it shows "Success" & the secret is created, click on 'Installed Operators' then click on 'MultiClusterHub'
. Inside 'MultiClusterHub' click on *'Create MultiClusterHub'*
. Leave the 'Name' section alone - it *MUST* be named 'multiclusterhub'
. Click on 'Advanced Configuration' drop down
    - Under 'Image Pull Secret' drop down select the 'Secret' name you created in the previous step
. Then click 'Create'
    - This process will take about 10 min for OCP to finish the install/configuration of the 'MultiClusterHub'
    - Once the 'Status' shows "Phase: Running" you should be good-to-go
. Select 'Networking' on the left and then 'Routes'
    - *AGAIN* Verify that the 'Project' dropdown at the top of the screen has 'open-cluster-management'
. Inside of 'Routes' click on the 'Location' link to bring up the 'multicloud-console' to access ACM
. Login to the 'multicloud-console' page with your OCP Cluster kubeadmin username/password
. After you've logged into the 'multicloud-console' look in the upper right corner for the "VisualWebTerminal" and click it

. Click on the 'Open in a new browser Tab' in the drop down
  image:images/Visual-Web-Terminal-New-Tab.png[]
. Next you need to do a 'oc get ClusterImageSet' on the CLI
  image:images/oc-get-ClusterImageSet.png[]
. You will then see a list of images - *NOTE - the ocp-release:4.6.x* image that was previously not in the original drop down list in the order form
  image:images/VisualWebTerminal-View-Images.png[]
. To make the image visible to be able to deploy to Azure Gov the yaml needs to be edited to allow the image to be visible - do this by the following:
  image:images/Edit-ClusterImageSet-visible-false.png[]
  *NOTE - the 'Visible: "false"'* This needs to be set to "true"
  image:images/Edit-ClusterImageSet-visible-true.png[]
  Make the edits and then select 'Apply Changes'
  image:images/ClusterImageSet-Apply-Changes.png[]
. Once the changes have been applied you are now able to go back to the Create Cluster form and start the build
  In the 'add cluster' => 'create cluster' UI make sure that the "YAML:On" is enabled
  image:images/Create-a-Cluster-YAML-on.png[]
  This will be needed to edit the YAML for Azure Gov specific line of code
. Fill out all the required info - for *Microsoft Azure*
. In the 'Node pools' drop down make the following changes:
  * In the 'Worker pool' delete the 'zones' *these are not needed for Azure Gov*
  * For the 'Region' box you will need to put in one of the Azure Gov specific regions. What is currently populated is for Azure Commercial
    - usgovvirginia
    - usgovarizona
    - usgoviowa
    - usgovtexas
. Once all forms are filled out properly you will need to add a line to the 'Cluster YAML' box on the right
  image:images/Create-a-Cluster-YAML-box.png[]
. Under 'Cluster YAML' ==> 'install-config' file, add the following line under *spec.platform.azure*
  "cloudName: AzureUSGovernmentCloud"
  image:images/Create-a-Cluster-edit-install-config-yaml.png[]
. Under 'Cluster YAML' ==> 'cluster' file, add the following line under *spec.platform.azure*
  "cloudName: AzureUSGovernmentCloud"
  image:images/Create-a-Cluster-edit-cluster-yaml.png[]
. Everything is filled in properly - you can now click 'Create' in the upper right
  The multicloud console will then redirect you to a 'creating' screen and will give you the opportunity to view the logs in the ACM OCP Cluster you are using


IMPORTANT: **As of this writing the 'destroy' cluster capabilities are not working for Azure Gov from ACM - you will need to destroy the cluster from ACM as well as go into Azure Gov UI and destroy the cluster**


IMPORTANT: **Also as far as the cluster showing up in ACM - it keeps a status of "importing cluster" even if the cluster is up and running**


*BUGZILLA's:*
- https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1900728 - Bug for ACM not able to destroy a cluster it had deployed to Azure Gov
- https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1899719 - Bug for ACM UI to take into account the Azure Gov options not just Commercial
