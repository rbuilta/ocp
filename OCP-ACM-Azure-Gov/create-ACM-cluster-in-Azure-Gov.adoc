============

This is a step-by-step guide to allow OpenShift ACM to deploy a cluster to Azure Gov Cloud. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes provides end-to-end management visibility and control to manage your Kubernetes environment. Provides management capabilities for cluster creation, application lifecycle, and provide security and compliance for all of them across data centers and hybrid cloud environments. Clusters and applications are all visible and managed from a single console, with built-in security policies. Run your operations from anywhere that Red Hat OpenShift runs, and manage any Kubernetes cluster in your fleet.

============

.Assumptions:  
- Have a OCP Cluster already built on *OCP 4.6.x*
- Connection to the internet for 'Operator Hub' to be able to pull operators
- Access to the following info:
    * OCP pull-secret
    * Public & Priv ssh keys
    * Azure Gov Creds
        ** TenantID
        ** SubscriptionID
        ** ClientID
        ** ClientSecret     




.Installation of Operator: Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes

****
.Ordered
. In the OCP cluster that ACM will be installed go to 'OperaterHub' and search for "Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes"
    - Select it and keep the defaults - then *Install*
    - Wait for installation to finish - should only take about 3 minutes
. While the operator is being installed there is a need to create a Secret for the 'MultiClusterHub' to use
    - On the left select 'Workloads' then select 'Secrets'
    - Verify that the 'Project' dropdown has 'open-cluster-management' so the secret can be used by the 'MultiClusterHub'
    - Inside of 'Secrets' click the "Create" in the upper right and then select 'Image Pull Secret' from the dropdown
    - Give the new 'Secret' a name
    - Then change the 'Authentication Type' to "Upload Configuration File"
        * You can either choose to upload a file via the 'Browse' or cut and paste the pull-secret that you used for building the OCP Cluster
    - Click 'Create'
. Once the installation of the operator has finished and it shows "Success" & the secret is created, click on 'Installed Operators' then click on 'MultiClusterHub'
. Inside 'MultiClusterHub' click on *'Create MultiClusterHub'* 
. Leave the 'Name' section alone - it *MUST* be named 'multiclusterhub'
. Click on 'Advanced Configuration' drop down
    - Under 'Image Pull Secret' drop down select the 'Secret' name you created in the previous step
. Then click 'Create'
    - This process will take about 10 min for OCP to finish the install/configuration of the 'MultiClusterHub'
    - Once the 'Status' shows "Phase: Running" you shoud be good-to-go
. Select 'Networking' on the left and then 'Routes'
    - *AGAIN* Verify that the 'Project' dropdown at the top of the screen has 'open-cluster-management'
. Inside of 'Routes' click on the 'Location' link to bring up the 'multicloud-console' to access ACM
. Login to the 'multicloud-console' page with your OCP Cluster Kubeadmin username/password
